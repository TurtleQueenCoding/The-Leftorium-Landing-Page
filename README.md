#FreeCodeCamp: RWD Projects: Landing Page
<p>This is the fourth project of the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp. The objective of this challenge is to build a product landing page that meets the 15 user stories specified by Free Code Camp. I decided to do my project on The Leftorium, a fictional store on <i>The Simspons</i>.
